    "**For 10 pairs of MNIST test images, selected at random, compute the code for each image of the pair. Now compute 7 evenly spaced linear interpolates between these codes, and decode the result into images. Prepare a figure showing this interpolate. Lay out the figure so each interpolate is a row. On the left of the row is the first test image; then the interpolate closest to it; etc; to the last test image. You should have a 10 rows and 9 columns of images. (45 points)**"
